\section{Design decisions}

Dependencies

- Python 2

- Pandas


- R package

On the companion website of the book ``Permutation Tests for Complex Data:
Theory, Applications and Software'' by F. Pesarin and L. Salmaso, the
authors provide several R functions to develop the application examples
presented in the book.\footnote{\url{http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/pesarin/material.html}}

Object-oriented programming

- formula-like objects?

Generic test statistics functions

- allow functions to be passed in, rather than strings
