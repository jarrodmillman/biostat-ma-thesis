\chapter{\label{app:ex}Worked examples}

For the following two worked examples, we assume that the following imports 
have been made.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from scipy import stats
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> from pandas import read_csv
\end{verbatim}

You will also need to have \texttt{permute} version 0.1a1 installed.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import permute
>>> permute.__version__
'0.1a1'
\end{verbatim}

Note that this is still designated as an \emph{alpha} release, so we are
making no guarantees regarding the stability of our package structure
or call signatures.  We do not have plans to break our API, but we are
allowing ourselves to continue refining our API as we gain experience
using the package and continue adding new functionality.  However, the
following example sessions will give you an idea of what working with
\texttt{permute} is like.

\section{Two sample permutation test}

The following example uses data from \cite{macnell2014s}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from permute.core import two_sample
\end{verbatim}


\section{Stratified Spearman correlation permutation test}

The following example use fake data similar to that used in \cite{boring2015}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from permute.stratified import sim_corr
\end{verbatim}
