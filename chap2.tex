\section{Core tools}

Compute the confidence interval for a binomial.

Simulate permutation p-value for Spearman correlation coefficient

Permute the rows of a matrix in-place

Permutation of condition within each group.

One-sided or two-sided, two-sample permutation test for equality of two means,
with p-value estimated by simulated random sampling with reps replications.

Tests the hypothesis that x and y are a random partition of x,y against the
alternative that x comes from a population with mean

a. greater than that of the population from which y comes, if side = ‘greater’

b. less than that of the population from which y comes, if side = ‘less’

c. different from that of the population from which y comes, if side = ‘two-sided’
