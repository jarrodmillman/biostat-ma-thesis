\section{Core tools}

Compute the confidence interval for a binomial.

Simulate permutation p-value for Spearman correlation coefficient

Permute the rows of a matrix in-place

Permutation of condition within each group.

One-sided or two-sided, two-sample permutation test for equality of two means,
with p-value estimated by simulated random sampling with reps replications.

Tests the hypothesis that x and y are a random partition of x,y against the
alternative that x comes from a population with mean

a. greater than that of the population from which y comes, if side = ‘greater’

b. less than that of the population from which y comes, if side = ‘less’

c. different from that of the population from which y comes, if side = ‘two-sided’

\section{Interrater reliability}

\subsection{Problem}

\cite{davies1982measuring, mchugh2012interrater}

\subsection{Method}

The test statistic within stratum $s$ is

\begin{align*}
\rho_s &\equiv \frac{1}{N_s {R \choose 2}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_s}
              \sum_{r=1}^{R-1} \sum_{v=r+1}^R 1(L_{s,i,r} = L_{s,i,v}) \\
       &= \frac{1}{N_s R(R-1)} \sum_{i=1}^{N_s}
                (y_{si}(y_{si}-1) + (R-y_{si})(R-y_{si}-1)).
\end{align*}

That is, within each stratum, we count the number of concordant pairs of
assignments.
