x capitalize title, too late?  already have signatures?

- missing functionality, what tests do we implement?

- appendix with a complete worked example. use SET data from Kellie or maybe dataset from book

- more on Python vs. R, Sandrine wondered why we didn't do this in R , would like to see more justification

- in SAS (and some R) have permutation implementations, literature review of competing packages, somewhat related to above comment

- page 1, where did example come from, made up.

- page 2, should use the terminology : paired t-test  (not one-sample t-test exactly).

- page 3, simulation to sampling (need to be more precise, add a few words)

- what is a strong null hypothesis ?  Make sure to define / talk w/Philip , Holland 1984 (Causal inference review maybe?)

- confidence set clearer explanation , maybe a picture, certainly needs expanding

- restructure.  move permutes to utils, what about core name?  simple, basic, standard, or maybe just leave it as core.
